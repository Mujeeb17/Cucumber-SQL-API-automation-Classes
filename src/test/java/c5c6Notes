Parametrization
    - : executing the same test case but with different sets of data
    -

- the term 'data driven' means the data is coming from an external source

Scenario Outline
    - provides an alternative to data driven testing
    - supports parametrization
    - this is always used along the keyword: Examples
    Ex:
    Scenario Outline:
        ...
        When user enters valid "<username>" and valid "<password>"
        ...
        Examples:
          | username | password    |
          | admin    | Hum@nhrm123 |
          | ADMIN    | Hum@nhrm123 |

DataTable
    - difference with Scenario outline is DataTable will loop through
      all sets of data at once, Scenario Outline will execute each set
      of data as a separate test case
        - Scenario Outline will execute Hooks before/after every data set
        - DataTable executes Hooks only once then runs every data set
          (because of this, you usually have to click 'back' or logout after each data set
          so that the loop continues)

Page Object Model
    - (no relation to pom.xml)
        - pom.xml is only for dependencies we need to add
    - an object repository
    - it stores all web elements specific to a particular page (in this project, an example is LoginPage inside Pages package)
    - you must also create a constructor in this class to initialize the web elements on the current page, Ex:
      public LoginPage() {
          PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
      }

- in order to generate reports
    - in runner class, change plugin to have the type of report, folder it should
      be stored in, and the file that should have it. ex:
        - plugin = {"html:target/Cucumber.html"}
          for html report that we want to store in target folder and we want to name it Cucumber.
          In order to actually see the report properly, open the report with chrome browser

        - plugin = {"json:target/Cucumber.json"}
          we are doing the same thing but with a json file. To see this report properly you
          must open in explorer then use notepad or word to open it

- in Constants class, user.dir gives you the path to the Project.
