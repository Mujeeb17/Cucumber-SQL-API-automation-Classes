Parametrization
    - : executing the same test case but with different sets of data
    -

- the term 'data driven' means the data is coming from an external source

Scenario Outline
    - provides an alternative to data driven testing
    - supports parametrization
    - this is always used along the keyword: Examples
    Ex:
    Scenario Outline:
        ...
        When user enters valid "<username>" and valid "<password>"
        ...
        Examples:
          | username | password    |
          | admin    | Hum@nhrm123 |
          | ADMIN    | Hum@nhrm123 |

DataTable
    - difference with Scenario outline is DataTable will loop through
      all sets of data at once, Scenario Outline will execute each set
      of data as a separate test case
        - Scenario Outline will execute Hooks before/after every data set
        - DataTable executes Hooks only once then runs every data set
          (because of this, you usually have to click 'back' or logout after each data set
           so that the loop continues)
