- TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
  ts will get the implementation for its method from RemoteWebDriver class
- ts.getScreenshotAs() method could return you either a byte array or actual file
  (it has the ability to store the screenshot as both types)

- several notes made inside screenshot methods in CommonMethods class

- instead of going to SmokeRunner class to run the test directly,
  we added a plugin in our pom.xml that allows us to run the class in a
  different way. (maven tab on the top right --> Project --> Lifecycle --> test)
    - if we wanted to add more runner classes, in the pom.xml plugin in <includes> tag,
      we can add it there

- in @CucumberOptions we added "rerun:target/failed.txt" which will add all the test cases that
  failed in the previous run to a falied.txt file inside target folder.
- we created a new runner class that will execute only the test cases that have failed

- sidenote: Jenkins only needs to know pom.xml location so it can run the tests
  (we have not used Jenkins so far)
