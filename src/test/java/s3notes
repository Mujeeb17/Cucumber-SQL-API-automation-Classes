- to integrate our db in framework, we created DBUtility class

- we added a scenario in AddEmployee.feature
    - to add employee and capture employees id from UI
    - and then verify it through the DB (we used firstname & lastname to verify)
- we added steps in AddEmployee stepDefinitions

    // VERIFICATION IS EXISTANCE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS
    // VALIDATION IS CHECKING OF ELEMENT IS EDITABLE

- NEVER USE IF ELSE OVER ASSERTIONS
- assertions are always preferred

- Cucumber uses JUnit assertions
