- In order to run a class on cucumber, you need:
    - a feature class
    - a step definitions class
    - a runner class

Feature class
    - this should always have the .feature extension
    - it should be in gherkin language
        - Keywords: Feature, Scenario, Given, When, And, Then
    - when you run this file, it will give you a template for the code
      that will be in your step definitions class which will be in java code

Step Definitions class
    - After pasting the rough template that was made with your feature file,
      you can now actually code what you say the program should do
    - Use gherkin keywords as annotations ex: @Given, @Then etc.

Runner class
    - This is the class you should run to execute the test case.
        - you are also able to run the test cases from the feature file but this is not preferred
    - in this class, above the class declaration, you must put the following:
        @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
        @CucumberOptions(features = pathToYour.featureClass, glue = pathToYourStepDefinitionsClass)
            - features path --> \path\path\
            - glue path --> path.path.path


 - features = maps where feature files are located in our framework
 - glue = maps where class files are located in our framework
 - dry run = true-> it will check which step of your feature file does not have glue code
