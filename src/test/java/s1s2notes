JDBC notes

- mysql connector java is the dependency we have added
  which allows us to use the methods that establish a connection
  to the database and so we can send queries
    - 3 things we need to work with the database
        - address of DB - url
        - name of DB
        - username, password

- Connections class: to establish connection with DB
- make a statement (Statement class): allows us to send query to DB
- ResultSet class: result of query will be stored in an object of this type
    - rset.next() : shifts the focus to the next row in the table
- ResultSetMetaData class : contains the information about a ResultSet object
  like how many rows/columns and names of columns etc.

- to integrate with the framework, we will pass url, username, and password in config.properties file

- note : important to ALWAYS close the connection to the database when you are done with it
  (this can be done in the 'finally' block of code)
    - order to close the connection:
         close resultset
         close statement
         close connection
